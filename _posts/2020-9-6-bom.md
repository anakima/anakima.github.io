## Preface

I recently started to give a friends alt a make-over. Early on in the process I figured that this would be the ideal chance to try out BOM. I had read about it but was too worried to try it on my own avatar. However, after collecting some positive experience with the alt, I felt ready to migrate all of my own outfits to BOM as well. This is the recap on what I did, how I did it, and why I did it. But let's start even a bit further â€¦

## What is BOM and where does it come from?

Let's start early. In the old days, there was no possibility to change your head or body other than changing it's shape and skin. All avatars were using the same mesh body and we'll refer to this as "system mesh" from now on. (There was even a default shape and we'd call her "Ruth", but that is another story.) In these early days, all clothes would just be painted on top of this system mesh and they'd have the same shape as the underlying body. This process is called "baking" and we'll refer to these kinds of clothes as "system clothes". There are also system eyes, system skin, etc.

If you wanted to hide certain parts of your body (e.g. in order to wear high heels), we'd use so called "Invisiprims". Those were prims with a sepcial texture. The effect was a bit like an x-ray scan. If you look through an Invisiprim, all system mesh behind it turns invisible to you. The draw back is that also system water and system sky are turned invisible, which is often an undeserired effect but it was the best we could do with the tools at hand. 

With the release of Viewer 2, Linden Lab also introduced Alpha Layers. So from there on you could create system clothes that would hide certain parts of your body, like an arm or a leg or your eyes, etc. This came in handy when Mesh was introduced. As there's no way to "detach" the system mesh body, you're now using alpha layers to hide it when attaching a different mesh body (or head). The new body is then treated as an attachment that is rigged to your skeleton, so it moves when your limbs move. Though it's still an attachment that's more or less independant of your system mesh body. That means that you're now not able anymore to wear system clothes or system skin, tattoo layers, eyes, etc. since all of these are still baked to your system mesh and then hidden by the alpha layer. So in order to have skin and tattoos and make-up on your new body and head, creators introduced "appliers" which would then draw onto the mesh of your new body, rather than onto the system mesh beneath. If you used appliers for some time then you noticed that there are different ones for different creators and you probably bought some "Omega" device at some point in time and maybe you were as confused and disgruntled with the overall situation as I was when I first tried to learn and understand what that was all about. However, I got used to it and it became the new normal. And then came BOM.

BOM is short for "Bakes on Mesh", because that's what it does. It bakes the new mesh body onto your system mesh body. This in turn allows you to use the system layers again for skin, eyes, tattoos (and clothes, although no one really wants to go back to system clothes, since we have fancy mesh clothes now).
It also means that you now have to get rid of the alpha layers again, because they don't play well with the new mesh bodies. Wearing an alpha layer on a new mesh body with BOM will make everything turn red for reasons unknown to me. But we don't need the alpha layer anyway, because all decent new mesh bodies have their HUDs to selectively hide certain parts of your body, so everything is fine and fluffy and rainbows and unicorns.

You just have to take the step ...

## Switching to BOM

If you're having a new avatar without any existing outfits etc then you're lucky and you should use BOM right from the start. Ensure that you're buying a BOM ready head and body. Then it's usually just a click on a BOM button somewhere on a HUD and you're using BOM. 

If you already have an existing outfits folder with different bodies and heads, things become a bit more difficult. That is the situation I was in with four different appearances (head/shape/skin/body) and more than 200 outfits. I was literally scared of switching to BOM, as it looked like something that potentially messes up all my outfits. Though after making some positive experiences with it I figured I should give it a try.

## Draw backs

Overall I'm quite happy with the switch. The only thing that bothers me is the moment when I change from an outfit with head/body A to an outfit of head/body B. Because for a brief amount of time (maybe a couple seconds) I'm not wearing a new mesh head but only the system mesh. No one would have seen that previously, because the system mesh would be hidden with the alpha layer. There's alpha layer anymore now and because the shapes used for the new mesh head differ so much from the ones you'd use with the system mesh, I briefely look like an Edvard Munch painting came to life. Which is quite emberassing, to be honest. Hence I tend to hide myself somewhere when changing outfits.
