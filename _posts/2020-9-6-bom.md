## Preface

I recently started to give a friends alt a make-over. Early on in the process I figured that this would be the ideal chance to try out BOM. I had read about it but was too worried to try it on my own avatar. However, after collecting some positive experience with with the alt, I felt ready to migrate all of my own outfits to BOM as well. This is the recap on what I did, how I did it, and why I did it. But let's start even a bit further â€¦

## What is BOM and where does it come from?

BOM is short for "Bakes On Mesh".

Well, BOM is the future.

System mesh, system skin, system eyes, etc.

## Inventory Categorization

When you start a new SL account, you'll already find a couple of system folders in your inventory. Like "Animations", "Body Parts", "Clothing", etc. Obviously, if you just dump every clothing item in the clothing folder, you'll have a bad time. So try to think early on about what kind of wearables you're likely to buy and how you could organize those in subfolders. I guess most of you have already done this intuitively. I displayed an example on the right.
