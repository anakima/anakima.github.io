description: A post describing why and how I'm trying to manage my inventory.

## Motivation

So I happened to have different Second Life accounts over time and the one thing they all had in common is that their inventory inevitably turned into a gigantic mess, which became unmanageable and hard to retrieve outfits from. When I switched to mesh with Anakima, I tried not to repeat this pattern and came up with different inventory management approaches. I don't want to claim they're perfect, but I want to describe the ones that kind of worked for me.

## Inventory Categorization

<span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/blog-inventory-categorization.png %}" alt="An screenshot of my outfits floater, showing some outfit categorizations." /></span>
When you start a new SL account, you'll already find a couple of system folders in your inventory. Like "Animations", "Body Parts", "Clothing", etc. Obviously, if you just dump every clothing item in the clothing folder, you'll have a bad time. So try to think early on about what kind of wearables you're likely to buy and how you could organize those in subfolders. I guess most of you have already done this intuitively. I displayed an example on the right.

I created a "Jewelery" subfolder in the "Clothing" folder and further distinguish between bracelets, ear rings, regular rings, garter belts, etc. Within bracelets for example, I further distinguish between wrist and ankle bracelets, as well as leg and arm bracelets. And within those I distinguish which shape they're fitted for, so I don't have to re-fit them every time I change my shape. 

Of course, your mileage my vary, bepending on what kind of wearables you're most likely to collect. The more items you have of a particular category, the more beneficial it would be to break those down in further subcategories.

## Outfit Categorization
<span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/blog-outfits-categorization.png %}" alt="An screenshot of my outfits floater, showing some outfit categorizations." /></span>
The categorization approach is kind of useable for individual clothing items (up to a certain degree), so I attemted to apply it to outfits as well. Since you can't have subfolders within Outfits (why?!), I tried to come up with a usable naming scheme. The current one I'm using is: 

<pre><code>[Shape] - [Style] - [Color] - [Brand] - [Name] - [Description] - [Number]</code></pre>

Let's break it down:

<dl>
  <dt>Shape</dt>
  <dd><p>This is the name of the shape that's included with the outfit. In my case, that's currently Ana, Kim, Kima, or Aki.</p></dd>

  <dt>Style</dt>
  <dd><p>This is the (sometimes difficult) attempt to categorize the style of an outfit. Some of my current styles include "Casual", "Sexy", "Swimwear", "Formal", etc.</p></dd>

  <dt>Color</dt>
  <dd><p>Well, yes, this is the color. I tried to go with high level color, rather than granular. So I don't distinguish different shades of pink, for example. If an outfit comes with a color changing HUD, I tag it with "Multi" instead of a color name.</p></dd>

  <dt>Brand</dt>
  <dd><p>Easy: That's the brand or designer name. <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/113388">Blueberry</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/57812">SPIRIT</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/215609">Spoiled</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/80395">Ricielli</a>, ...</p></dd>

  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd><p>This is the name the designer gave to an outfit. It's not always easy to name it, considering that an outfit usually contains wearables by different designers, though I try to take the name from the most prominent clothing piece of the outfit. Like: If the sweater is the front and center of your outfit and the pants are just a necessary detail, then the name of the sweater becomes the name of the outfit.</p></dd>

  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd><p>This turned out to be useful in the beginning but unmanageable later on. I used to describe in short words what the outfit looks like (e.g.: hoody dress w/ leggings). Unfortunately, there's a character limit for outfits that will cut off your description at some point. So I'm not using this approach often anymore.</p></dd>

  <dt>Number</dt>
  <dd><p>I number all my outfits (minus the shape). So if Ana and Aki have the same clothes, both outfits get the same number. The number will become clearer in the next chapter and is the most helpful identification mechanism I'm using these days.</p></dd>
</dl>

## Outfit Visualization

<span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/blog-wardrobe.png %}" alt="" /></span>
So far, I guess my management approach is pretty similar to yours. However, once I collected more than say 50 different outfits, it started to become difficult to find the right one. As of the time of writing, I'm approaching 200 different outfits (multiplied by the number of shapes ...) so it didn't scale anymore as I had a hard time remembering how different outfits looked like, just from the description. 

So the next step was to somehow visualize the outfits. I had heard about <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/CTS-Wardrobe-Organize-your-outfits-with-style-A-visual-inventory-organizer/935078">the CTS Wardrobe</a> and loved the idea of it, though I didn't feel comfortable giving a random web application RLV access to my account. I'd really love to have Linden Lab replicate this on their webiste, though up until then, I did the next best thing:

I started to take snapshots for every outfit I own (always in front of a neutral background, ideally with same windlight settings and pose) and stored them in an outfits folder on my hard drive. The images are named "Snapshot 001", "Snapshot 002", etc. I then added that number to the outfit names (it's the "number" listed above) and tadaaa... So whenever I want to change my outfit, I scroll through this folder, look up the number of the outfit I want to wear, search for it in my "Outfits" floater in the viewer, pick the right shape and then I can wear it. I know it's not as comfortable as the wardrobe linked above, but it's good enough for me for the moment. And I don't have to use RLV for it.

## Misc

While managing outfits, I ran into a different problem as well: "How do I add an item to every outfit I own?". In the particular situation, I received a ring of sentimental value and I wanted to add it to every outfit. Though that could be anything really... like an animation HUD or an AO or whatever. Firestorm offers the "Replace all links" feature to exchange (or remove) links, though adding new links to every outfit requires manual labor. So once I had the problem, I didn't just add the ring to the outfits. I also added five placeholder items. These are just little cubes with transparent texture that I can just wear. They aren't visible, though should I ever want to add something to every outfit again, I can just replace the link to one of these placeholder items. Well, up to five times. Let's just hope I don't need it more often.

## Recap

So this is the way I'm currently managing my inventory and outfits. With categorization and a bit of visualization. I already see that I probably need to start taking pictures of different clothing items (like rings and jewelery) so I can speed up the building process of outfits. E.g.: Finding matching shoes for a new dress. But I'm procrastinating that as it sounds like a lot of work again.

Do you have any good tipps and tricks for outfit and inventory management? I'd love to hear them! You can write me inworld or <a href="https://my.secondlife.com/anakima">leave a comment on my SL page</a>.
