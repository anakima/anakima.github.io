## Preface

Let's start with a disclaimer: I'm not a proper photographer, nor do I claim to be a decent amateur. I started looking into the topic when I wanted to get a nice profile picture but couldn't decide which photographer to hire in SL. I figured I could try out a couple of things on my own to get a better feeling for what I wanted things to look like. Part of the process was reading some blog articles, watching video tutorials, and taking pictures <a href="https://my.secondlife.com/anakima">to post on my feed</a>.
