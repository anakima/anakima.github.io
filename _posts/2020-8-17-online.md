So this website went online today. I'm not really sure why, though I just badly wanted to get the domain and once I had it... well, here we are.

Please know that I'm horrible with keeping things up to date, but I'll give it a try. And if the stars align correctly, there might be more blog posts in the future. Up until then, there's an ["about me" page to read](/landing.html).
