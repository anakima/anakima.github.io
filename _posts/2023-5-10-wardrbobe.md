## Intro

It's been three years since I wrote the previous article about why and how I try to manage my inventory and outfits. That's a lot of [Fifty Linden Fridays](https://www.seraphimsl.com/category/recurring-events/weekend-sales/fifty-linden-fridays/), [Access Happy Weekend Sales](https://www.access-sl.com/hwsale), [Saturday Sales](https://www.seraphimsl.com/category/recurring-events/s/saturday-sale-the/), [So Kawaii Sundays](https://www.sokawaiisundays.com/) and more. So you can imagine that my inventory grew **a lot** and I had to adjust my former approaches.

## What changed?

The first thing I changed was to slightly adjust the naming for my outfits. Instead of the previous scheme:

<pre><code>[Shape] - [Style] - [Color] - [Brand] - [Name] - [Description] - [Number]</code></pre>

I now put the number in the beginning and got rid of the description. So it is now:

<pre><code>[Number] [Shape] - [Style] - [Color] - [Brand] - [Name]</code></pre>

This made sorting and rediscovery easier for me.

I then stopped with taking local pictures and instead went with the previously mentioned <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/CTS-Wardrobe-Organize-your-outfits-with-style-A-visual-inventory-organizer/935078">CTS  Wardrobe</a>. Why did I perform that change? Well, what I didn't understand back then is, that there are different ways the wardrobe can be used. Either exclusively for inventory management or also for dressing up. As I had no interest in the RLV integration, I opted for the approach to exclusively use it for management.

The wardrobe web application allows you to upload pictures of your item or outfit and to tag it with an arbitrary amount of keywords, in order to find it again. I tend to tag items with the body type they're rigged for (e.g. Maitreya Lara, Maitreya Lara Petite, eBody Reborn, etc), the type of clothing it is (e.g. pants, top, dress, skirt), and sometimes the style they're having (e.g. kawaii, formal, sporty, etc.). For some items, it's beneficial to add some more keywords and wardrobe allows you to cluster them. E.g. for footwear, I use the sub-tags: boots, thighhigh, overknees, heels, platforms, sandals, sneakers, socks, and misc. These I can then use to find for example: All overknees heels in my inventory that fit eBody Reborn. With pictures! How amazing is that?

## Conclusion

In hindsight I have to say: I should have done this sooner and am very happy with how everything turned out. It took a while to import and tag previously acquired clothes, though it was time that was very well spent and already paid off.

If you're starting with wardrobe, my tip would be to [join the "Get It Sorted" Discord server](https://discord.gg/RrhdZNEyEC) and to browse a couple of public wardrobes, to a get a feeling which tag structures other people are using and what might work best for you. The server also has links to text and video tutorials, which deliver tons of helpful information to get started.
E.g. the feature I'm now using very often and which I wouldn't have found otherwise is the ability to send snapshots to wardrobe directly from the SL viewer.

I'm using it for clothing, body parts (hair, eyes, ...), cosmetics, accessories, and even for furniture. Almost every new item gets imported into wardrobe, ideally directly after buying it, so it's always current and I don't build up a backlog that I have to eventually tackle.
If you're struggling with your inventory: Give it a try!
