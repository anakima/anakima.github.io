		<p>Anakima is the name of my account in the virtual world of <a href="https://secondlife.com">Second Life</a>. I'm living there as Anakima on and off since 2014 and am spending my time sitting on things. It's a very important skill in this world and I've mastered it. If I'm not sitting, I might <a href="https://my.secondlife.com/anakima">attempt to take pictures</a> or I'm shopping for outfits. I just love to style my avatar in different ways and be <a target="blank" href="https://slbloodlines.com/members/2662527">an angel</a> (or not). You'll find some of my appearances beneath.</p>

					<h3>Ana</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Ana was my first atempt at a mesh avatar. She was born around November 2019 I think, wearing a Maitreya Lara body (like my other avas, too) alongside a Catwa head. It might be silly to assign different characteristics to the different avatars, as there's still the same person behind them... though I feel she brings out a more <i>ana</i>lytical side of me.</p>

					<h3>Kima</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Kima and Kim were born when the GENUS Project released their group gift called <i>GIFT001</i>. Decent mesh heads are pretty expensive in Second Life, so I wouldn't have tried a different one after already being happy with Ana's head. Though since it was free, I figured: Let's have fun! And fun it was. And still is. Kima brings out a more bossy and sassy side of me.</p>

					<h3>Kim</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Anatomically, Kim is a twin of Kima. Same shape, same head, same body, just different skin, hair, make-up... and personality. She's softer and more hesitant, I think.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>Aki is the youngest of the bunch. She's wearing a GENUS Project head as well, though a different one than Kima and Kim. I was really looking forward to the re-opening of GENUS once they got through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/secondlife/comments/g0xar1/the_genus_project_situation_dmca_store_closure/">their first DMCA takedown</a>. So I went to their main shop on re-opening day and fought through the lag to get Akis head. It was well worth the wait, as I'm seen as Aki most often these days. Despite the brooding look in the picture on the right, she's actually quite warm and loving.</p>
